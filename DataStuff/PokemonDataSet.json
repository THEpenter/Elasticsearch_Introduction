It's DNA is actually almost the same as Mew's, but it's body is size are vastly different. It's cold, glowing eyes strike fear into its foes. Because its psychic abilies were raised to the ultimate level, it only thinks about defeating it's enemies as it rests in an undiscovered cave. But even though it has powerful body, scientists failed to give it a compassionate heart and it turned vicious as a result. It rests to conserve energy, so that it can unleash its full power in battle. The research efforts of Dr. Fuji led him to create Mewtwo.

It's DNA is said to contain the genetic code of every Pokemon and every move. Because of this, many scientists believe that it's the ancestor of all pokemon. If you view it's body under a microscope, you can see it's fine, small and delicate hairs. It is capable of turning invisible at will so that people are unaware of its presence. It is considered one of the original pregenetor Pok\u00e9mon, as all Pok\u00e9mon descend from Mew. It fought Mewtwo during the Pok\u00e9mon movies."}]
