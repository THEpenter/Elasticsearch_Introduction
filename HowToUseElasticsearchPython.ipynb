It's DNA is said to contain the genetic code of every Pokemon and every move. Because of this, many scientists believe that it's the ancestor of all pokemon. If you view it's body under a microscope, you can see it's fine, small and delicate hairs. It is capable of turning invisible at will so that people are unaware of its presence. It is considered one of the original pregenetor Pokémon, as all Pokémon descend from Mew. It fought Mewtwo during the Pokémon movies.\"}},\n",

It will eat them in emergencies, then it\\'ll run off to find a new one. They were so rare at one point that people bred them to regrow the population, and it worked. There are good stalks and bad stalks, and since it can\\'t live with out them, it will defend it with its life. It was originally called \"Okupan\" in early development and was intended to have an evolution named \"Madame\" in Generation II\\'s early development. Its Galarian form is a Fighting type, appears to resemble a feudal Japan-style samurai or ronin, and uses a larger onion-stalk. In Pokémon Go, it is exclusive to certain regions of Asia.'}}]}"
